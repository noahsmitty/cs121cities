# Where am I?
### BY: Noah, Arun, Chuksi, Josh and Giovanni.

This is project we created for our CS121 class software development class. We built an app that is able to identify which city you give it. So you select and upload an image and it would tell you where that image is. It identifies these cities based on whether it's a skyline image or city landmark; you choose.

Currently, it can only identify between 6 cities and when you actually upload the image, it isn't able to predict it yet. We are working towards full functionality in the coming weeks.

Our project was created using a fastai model deployed via Flask and Heroku.
